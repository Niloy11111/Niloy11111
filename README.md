As a MERN developer, I have experience in full-stack web development, including frontend and backend. My expertise lies in React.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I have a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and have worked on various projects to hone my skills. My vision is to continue learning and growing as a developer, staying updated with the latest trends and technologies in the MERN stack.
